<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;">Graphical Interface & Clipboard Management</span></span><br /><br /></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 17pt;">The Graphical User Interface</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">There are 2 possible options for the graphical interface that you can choose from. The default one, called <strong>Clipboard Manager</strong>, shows all 5 clips, their contents, and all the modes. The other one, called<strong> QuickBoard</strong>, is more compact and can be seen as a minimal version of the main manager window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- To go from Clipboard Manager to QuickBoard and vice versa, click on <strong>Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- To keep the window on top of the other windows, click on <strong>Stay on top</strong>, also in Options. This is recommended when you are working on one screen and want to keep track with the clipboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- <strong>Exit </strong>the software by either click on the X button at the top right corner of the window (either Clipboard Manager or QuickBoard) or choose Exit from the tray menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 17pt;">Clipboard Management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">A <strong>Clip</strong> is one of the five available indexed text stored in the memory and really to be used any time you like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- To make a Clip <em>active</em>, check on the box to the write of the Clip in the <strong>Clipboard Manager</strong>. To disable a clip, simply uncheck the box. When a clip is not active and <A HREF="cycleMode.htm">Cycle Mode</A> is on, the clip is skipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- To <em>focus</em> onto the clip in Cycle Mode (ON), simply press <A HREF="hotkeys.htm">CTRL + NUMBER</A> (where NUMBER can be any key from 1 to 5). Within the Clipboard Manager window, you can focus onto the clip by clicking the radio button on the left of the clip. The focused clip will have this button in blue. If using QuickBoard, the clip showed is always <em>in focus </em>(or last used when Cycle Mode is OFF); bring a clip into focus by clicking the button to the left of the clip, which will cycle through the active clips, incrementing by one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- In the Clipboard Manager, you can view the full text stored in the clip. To do so, click on <strong>expand</strong>. You can edit the text and save it from the popped up window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15pt;">- Click <strong>Clear All</strong> inside the Clipboard Manager to empty all the clips.</span></p>
