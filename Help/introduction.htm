<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 300%;"><span style="font-size: 15pt;">In a few words, MultiClip is a simple software that allows you to copy five different texts and paste any of them at will at any time you want (plus one text from the default clipboard). Some additional features help you cycle through a certain numbers of items or switch form copying to pasting with just a press of a button.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 300%;"><span style="font-size: 15pt;">Quick shoutout to the AutoIt community: this program is written entirely in AutoIt. AutoIt is a great, easy-to-use but powerful Windows scripting language; it has not only a very clear and resourceful documentation, but also a fantastic community that dates back a decade ago.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 300%;"><span style="font-size: 15pt;">Please refer to this help file whenever you need a clear instruction or explanation on a certain feature or option in the program. If you think there are places for improvements or discover bugs or confusing instructions, please email me at <a href="mailto:linkfarius.pnq@gmail">linkfarius.pnq@gmail</a>.
