MultiClip_AutoIt

An AutoIt Windows application that allows multiple copies/pastes with a simple GUI.

Features:
- MultiClip allows five independent "clips" for instant text copy/paste and does not interfere the Windows default clipboard.
- Hotkeys are utilized for convenience. Unfortunately, hotkeys are currently not customizable from GUI (but of course can be changed in the code)
- MultiClip allows circling through specified "clips" for better data entry automation.
